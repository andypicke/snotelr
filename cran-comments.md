Dear CRAN team,

This is an update of the {snotel} package (version 1.2). This package calculates and visualize 'SNOTEL' snow data and seasonality.

The update includes a correction to the snow seasonality algorithm, adds access to the SNOTELITE network and improves the shiny GUI for downloads and visualization.

Kind regards,
Koen Hufkens
